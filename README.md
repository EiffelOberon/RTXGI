# RTXGI SDK v1.1.30

This repository contains the RTX Global Illumination (RTXGI) SDK v1.1.30, the "Test Harness" sample application, the RTXGI Unreal Engine 4 plugin, and associated documentation.

* The core RTXGI SDK is in the `rtxgi-sdk` directory
* The sample application is the `samples` directory
* The RTXGI UE4 plugin is in the `ue4-plugin` directory
* The User Guide and Documentation is in the `docs` directory

### Change Log

The change log for the SDK and UE4 plugin is now available in the [Change Log](docs/manual/Changelog.html) section of the documentation.

## The RTXGI plugin now comes *pre-installed* in the [NVIDIA RTX branch of UE4 (NvRTX)](https://developer.nvidia.com/unrealengine)!

**Access to NvRTX is available to everyone!** To use NvRTX, youâ€™ll need a GitHub account and an Epic Games account that are linked. Instructions to do this are available at https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github. Once that process is complete, you will be able to access the NvRTX GitHub repository at https://github.com/NvRTX/UnrealEngine. Use the latest NvRTX and say goodbye to patches :-). 

**The RTXGI v1.1.30 plugin supports NvRTX and Vanilla UE 4.26.1**. If you are using older 4.25 or 4.26 versions of Unreal Engine, the v1.1.23 plugin patches are still available. **You will need to upgrade to 4.26.1 to use the latest v1.1.30 plugin**. For more information on the RTXGI Unreal Engine 4 plugin, see the [Unreal Engine 4 Plugin section](docs/manual/UE4Plugin.html) of the documentation.

### Getting Started with the RTXGI SDK
To see RTXGI in action, follow the below steps to build the SDK and run the Test Harness sample application:

1. Open Cmake
2. Copy the path to where you downloaded this source package. Add `/samples` to this path on the "source code" line
3. Copy the path to where you downloaded this source package. Add `/samples/build` to this path on the the "binaries" line (below "source code")
4. Select `Configure` in Cmake<br>
	4a. If using VS2017, you must also select `x64` as platform for generator in the dropdown<br>
	4b. If using VS2019, the platform is `x64` by default
5. Select `Generate` in Cmake
6. Open `samples/build/RTXGISamples.sln` in the build directory (created by CMake) and build the solution
7. Run `samples/runTestHarness.bat` to run the test harness sample application with the default settings

### Building the SDK Only
If you want to build just the RTXGI SDK, and aren't interested in samples, follow these steps:

1. Open Cmake
2. Copy the path to where you downloaded this source package, and add `/rtxgi-sdk/` to this path on the "source code" line
3. Copy the path to where you downloaded this source package, and add `/rtxgi-sdk/build` to this path on the "source code" line
4. Select `Configure` in Cmake<br>
	4a. If using VS2017, you must also select `x64` as platform for generator in the dropdown<br>
	4b. If using VS2019, the platform is `x64` by default	
5. Select `Generate` in Cmake
6. Open `rtxgi-sdk/build/RTXGI.sln` and build the solution. By default a static library is generated

### Test Harness Notes
- You can change the loaded scene through an initialization file passed to the Test Harness on the command line. See the `config/` directory.
- DDGIVolume, lights, camera, visualization, input, and scene settings can be modified in the initialization file.
- Two test scenes are included with the SDK distribution in GLTF format, a Cornell Box and the "Two Rooms" scene.
- An initialization file is also included for a third scene, the Crytek Sponza. You can download the scene from the [GLTF GitHub](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/tree/master/2.0/Sponza).
- A progressive path tracing mode is included for reference and can be toggled at runtime.
- A user interface is implemented with ImGui. It displays information that is useful when debugging and setting up new scenes / probe configurations.
